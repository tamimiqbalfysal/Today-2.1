    "reasoning": "The data structure prioritizes authorization independence and simplicity for the 'Simple Sign Up' application.  The core entity is `UserAccount`. Since the application's requirements are centered around user creation and management, a simple path-based ownership model is used. All UserAccount documents are stored in a `users` collection, using the Firebase Auth UID as the document ID, enabling straightforward security rules. This path-based ownership (`/users/{userId}`) inherently provides authorization independence, as each user's data is directly accessible via their UID without needing to traverse parent documents. This avoids complex `get()` calls in security rules. The structure supports QAPs by ensuring that listing users is only possible with appropriate authorization, typically admin roles which are not described in this request."
